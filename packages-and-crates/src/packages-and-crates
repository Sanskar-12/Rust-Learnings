so starting with crates

so crates are in simple term is called a single file
there are two types of crates 
1. Binary crates
2. Library crates

so Binary crates can be compiled and executable and have a main function ---- for eg we created guess the game file
Library crates cannot be compiled and executable and dont have a main function but it can be used inside Binary crates to provide extra functionality to the Binary crates It contains all the functions which we can use in our binary crate ----- for eg rand Library crate to create random numbers

so the code we write inside rust we write it on Binary crates

so Packages may be called as a folder which contain one or more binary crates and only one Library crate

now how rust can identify binary crates and Library crates 
so src/main.rs is a Root binary crate
and src/lib.rs is a Root library crate
